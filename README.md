## Development

### Materialize components ES6

Materialize is written in ECMAScript 6. The version of Uglify in use in Apostrophe 2.x does not necessarily support ES6 syntax! So if you want to add new materialize components you need to run `npm build` in project folder and copy the desired files from the created build folder to `lib/apostrophe-assets/vendor/materialize/components`.
